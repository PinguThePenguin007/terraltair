## Documentation
The assembler documentation will be in GitHub wiki for now:
* [The GitHub wiki](https://github.com/PinguThePenguin007/terraltair/wiki)

* [The instruction layout](https://github.com/PinguThePenguin007/terraltair/blob/main/TerrAltair%20instruction%20layout.txt)

## Assembler

Download the archive from the [releases tab](https://github.com/PinguThePenguin007/terraltair/releases) according to your operating system and unpack it.

### How to run it
#### Linux
Install Lua using your distribution's package manager:
##### Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install lua
```
##### Fedora
```
sudo dnf install lua
```
##### Arch (and its derivatives)
```
sudo pacman -S lua
```
--- 
<a name="linux-and-macos-instructions"></a>

First, you may need to give the script execution permissions:
```
chmod +111 terraltair_assembler.lua
```
Run the script:
```
lua terraltair_assembler.lua --help
```
Or:
```
./terraltair_assembler.lua --help
```

#### Windows

Run one of the .bat scripts included in the [release](https://github.com/PinguThePenguin007/terraltair/releases). The script names should be self-explanatory ðŸ˜‰

If you want to "build" the release yourself, you'll need to download [the latest Lua binary](https://luabinaries.sourceforge.net/download.html) and put it in the same directory as the assembler and the scripts.

#### MacOS
(Exact instructions TODO, need a Mac tester. Please reach out if you want to help)

I think you'll need brew if you don't want to compile Lua from source. Instructions are [here](https://brew.sh/)

Open your terminal app and run:

```
brew update
brew install lua
```

Follow [those](#linux-and-macos-instructions) instructions next.
